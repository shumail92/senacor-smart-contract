/* TODOS:
 - put mistakes on chain ?
 - changeCategory() // based on crash
 - optimize
 - add modifier for insuranceOwnerCalls only
 - update crashFreeYears & Category of driver based on history
 
DONE
- implement tiers of payment for score. 0-35, 35-70, >70
    -factor of 2.
- category of driver & diff pricing
- determine amount to charge based on score
- withdraw insurance
- make payable function, get ether & fund tokens?
- any possibility of getting rid of _customer address in calls?
